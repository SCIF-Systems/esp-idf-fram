# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and small when possible.
- Avoid dynamic allocation; this component is designed to be no-heap.
- Add tests for new behavior, especially for crash-recovery logic.
- Run formatting/linting consistent with ESP-IDF style where applicable.

## Pull Requests

- Include a clear description of the change and its motivation.
- If you change public APIs, update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Issues

Please include:
- ESP-IDF version
- Target hardware (e.g., FM25V02A on ESP32)
- Steps to reproduce
